# Statistical Inference Coursera

##Part 1

A repository for the course project of the Statistical Inference coursera class

Illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials.  
You should:

1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

##Part 2

  Now in the second portion of the class, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package. 
Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses 
Provide a basic summary of the data.
Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)
State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
